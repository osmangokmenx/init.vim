- [fuzzy finder (fzf)](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Installation

After installing the requirements:

- `git clone https://github.com/osmangokmenx/init.nvim ~/.config/nvim`
- Start `nvim` and it will do the rest
- press enter if there are any errors (don't worry its fine)

## Plugins

Thanks to vim-plug the plugins are lazy loaded (anything that is not needed for
the current buffer is not loaded) for example opening a python file means all
other non python related plugins are not loaded. Coc extensions are lazy loaded
as well, they work the same way as vim-plug plugins.

## Customizations

Since the file is pretty small its very easy to interpret by even those who
don't have any knowledge about vim script, most of the sections have comments
about their functionality, and can be removed, commented out or swapped easily,
there are some defaults that are not everyone's cup of tea (after all this is
highly opinionated).

- **Disabling Plugins:** comment out the plug's 'Plugin/name' line from config
  and also remove the plugin settings

- **Disabling CoC Plugins:** comment out the plugin from `coc_global_extensions`
  variable and uninstall it via `:CocUninstall` plugin name

- **Installing CoC plugins:** open `:CocList` and search for marketplace, you
  can find all available plugins here

- **Adding Bookmarks:** to add bookmarks to the start page, find
  `g:startify_bookmarks` in `init.nvim` and add the new bookmark just like the
  already present ones, the dictionary key is the shortcut you will use to
  quickly jump to that folder from the start page and the value is the path to
  targeted folder
